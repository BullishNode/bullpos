FINDINGS_COUNT: 8
BLOCKERS: 3
REVIEW_TYPE: re-review
SUMMARY: Integration tests are well-written but cannot pass against current main. Three blocking issues: (1) All API routes are TODO stubs - tests will 404, (2) Test data generators make unverified assumptions about API contracts, (3) Tests must be skipped or PR blocked until issue #7 complete. Non-blocking recommendations include adding edge case tests for SQL injection, XSS, and proper PGP key validation.
