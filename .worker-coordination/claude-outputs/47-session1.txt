# Issue #47 - Session 1 Output

## Issue Details
- **Title:** [bullbitcoin-mobile] Implement payment detail screen
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Repository:** Should be bullbitcoin-mobile, routed to bullpos
- **Error Type:** ROUTING_ERROR_MOBILE

## Investigation Summary

### Routing Error Confirmed
Issue #47 is a clear routing error. The issue:
1. Explicitly declares "Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile" in the issue body
2. Has "[bullbitcoin-mobile]" prefix in the title
3. Lists only Flutter/Dart files as targets:
   - lib/features/merchant_payments/ui/payment_detail_screen.dart
   - lib/features/merchant_payments/ui/widgets/payment_info_card.dart
   - lib/features/merchant_payments/ui/widgets/transaction_info.dart

### Codebase Reality
bullpos repository contains:
- backend/ (Node.js Lightning Network)
- frontend/ (TypeScript web POS interface)
- src/ (Shared utilities)

bullpos has ZERO Flutter/Dart code and no lib/features/ directory structure.

### Technology Stack Mismatch
- **Required:** Flutter widgets, BuildContext, Scaffold, Dart
- **Available in bullpos:** HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Node.js

Compatibility: 0%

### Root Cause Analysis
The conductor system extracts repository name from worktree path:
```
/tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullpos/overnight/issue-47
                        ^^^^^^^
```

Instead of parsing the bracketed prefix from issue title:
```
[bullbitcoin-mobile] Implement payment detail screen
```

### Pattern Recognition
This is the third documented instance of this routing error pattern:
- Issue #42: [bullbitcoin-mobile] → bullpos (PR #98)
- Issue #44: Multi-repo coordination failure (PR #101)
- Issue #47: [bullbitcoin-mobile] → bullpos (THIS ISSUE)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Documentation Created
Created `.github/issues/ROUTING_ERROR_47.md` with:
- Complete diagnostic information
- Codebase reality check
- Root cause analysis
- Recommended remediation steps
- Links to related routing errors

### 2. PR Creation (Next Step)
Will create PR with documentation to:
- Track this routing error
- Provide diagnostic info for maintainers
- Satisfy completion signal requirements

## Recommendations

1. **Close issue #47 in bullpos** - Cannot be implemented here
2. **Verify bullbitcoin-mobile repo exists** - May need to create it
3. **Re-route to correct repository** - If it exists
4. **Fix conductor.sh routing logic** - Parse [repo-name] prefix from titles
5. **Audit entire batch** - Check all 56 issues in batch-20260127-181138-2751594

## Dependencies
Issue #47 depends on issue #46, which is likely also a routing error (part of same batch, sequence 46).

## Completion Status
- [x] Routing error identified and confirmed
- [x] Documentation file created
- [ ] PR created (next step)
- [ ] Completion signal output
