REPOSITORY MISMATCH - CANNOT COMPLETE

Issue: #41
Expected Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile (Flutter/Dart)
Actual Repository: bullpos (TypeScript/Node.js)

Issue #41 Context:
- Add image attachment support to invoice builder
- Requires Flutter/Dart code changes
- Files: lib/features/merchant_payments/ui/widgets/image_attachment.dart
- Dependencies: Issue #40

Current Repository Context:
- bullpos - Browser-based POS system
- TypeScript/React frontend
- No Flutter/Dart code present
- No merchant_payments feature module

Root Cause:
The vibelord worker was directed to work on a bullbitcoin-mobile issue
in the bullpos repository worktree. These are separate projects with
completely different tech stacks.

Required Action:
- Route issue #41 to bullbitcoin-mobile repository
- Or mark as routing error in conductor

This is a ROUTING ERROR, not a code issue.
