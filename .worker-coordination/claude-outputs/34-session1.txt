**CRITICAL ISSUE**: Issue #34 was routed to the wrong repository workspace.

- **Issue #34** is for `bullbitcoin-mobile` (Flutter app)
- **Current workspace** is `bullpos` (Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Cannot implement**: Flutter/Dart code in wrong tech stack

**PR #90** documents this routing error with:
- Full evidence of mismatch
- Correct workspace location needed
- Issue requirements for correct implementation

**Required action**: Vibelord system must create workspace at `/tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullbitcoin-mobile/overnight/issue-34` and retry.
