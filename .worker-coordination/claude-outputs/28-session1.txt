## Summary

Issue #28 was a plan-decomposer error - it was created in the wrong repository. The issue explicitly states it's for "bullbitcoin-mobile" and requires Dart domain entities, but it was created in the "bullpos" repository which only contains TypeScript/JavaScript code.

**Resolution:**
- Created PR #85 documenting the repository mismatch
- Added `ISSUE_28_MISMATCH.md` explaining the problem
- The issue should be transferred to the correct repository (bullbitcoin-mobile)

**Confidence: 10/10** - This is definitively a repository mismatch that cannot be implemented in the current codebase.
