Excellent! The work is complete. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished.

## Summary

Successfully completed issue #27: Created the merchant_payments feature structure in the bullbitcoin-mobile repository following Clean/Hexagonal architecture patterns.

### What was accomplished:

1. **Cloned the bullbitcoin-mobile repository** - The repository was already forked to BullishNode/bullbitcoin-mobile from the upstream SatoshiPortal/bullbitcoin-mobile.

2. **Created the merchant_payments feature structure** with proper layering:
   - `domain/` - For entities, repository contracts, service contracts, and usecases
   - `data/` - For datasources, models, and repository implementations
   - `presentation/` - For BLoCs/Cubits state management
   - `ui/` - For screens and widgets

3. **Added merchant_payments_locator.dart** - Created the dependency injection setup file for the feature with TODO comments for future implementation.

4. **Registered the feature in lib/locator.dart** - Added import and setup call to integrate merchant_payments into the app's dependency injection system.

5. **Verified no compilation errors** - Ran Flutter analysis which passed with no issues.

6. **Created PR #1** - https://github.com/BullishNode/bullbitcoin-mobile/pull/1

All acceptance criteria from issue #27 have been met:
- ✅ Feature folder structure matches architecture docs
- ✅ All required subfolders created
- ✅ Feature registered in app
- ✅ No compilation errors
