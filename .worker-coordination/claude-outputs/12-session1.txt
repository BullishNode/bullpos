## Summary

Successfully implemented payment link route and URL fragment parsing for issue #12:

### Created Files:
1. **`frontend/src/utils/url-parser.ts`** - URL parsing utilities with functions to:
   - Extract link ID from `/p/{linkId}` path
   - Extract AES key from URL fragment (after #)
   - Validate AES key format (43 chars base64url = 32 bytes)
   - Parse and validate complete payment link URLs

2. **`frontend/src/pages/PaymentLinkPage.ts`** - Payment link page component:
   - Parses current URL on initialization
   - Displays placeholder with extracted link ID and key
   - Shows user-friendly error messages for invalid URLs
   - Includes TODO comments for future backend/decryption integration

### Modified Files:
1. **`frontend/index.ts`** - Updated router to:
   - Detect `/p/:id` routes before hash-based routing
   - Dynamically import PaymentLinkPage to minimize bundle size
   - Handle browser back/forward navigation with popstate event

### Validation:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint validation passed (fixed unnecessary escape characters)
- ✅ Webpack build successful
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met

The implementation provides a solid foundation for payment link handling. The placeholder page is ready for integration with the backend API and AES decryption logic in future issues.
