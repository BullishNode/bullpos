# Issue #48 - Session 1 Output

## Status: BLOCKED - Repository Routing Error

## Detection Summary
- Issue requests Flutter/Dart mobile development in bullbitcoin-mobile
- Worker routed to bullpos TypeScript/Node.js web application
- Technology stack incompatibility: 0% code reuse possible
- This is the 8th occurrence of this systematic conductor routing bug

## Actions Taken
1. Detected repository mismatch via issue title prefix analysis
2. Created comprehensive routing error documentation (ROUTING_ERROR_48.md)
3. Documented session output for maintainer review

## Files Created
- `.github/issues/ROUTING_ERROR_48.md` - Full diagnostic report
- `.worker-coordination/claude-outputs/48-session1.txt` - This session log

## Required Resolution
Manual intervention required to:
1. Close this issue in bullpos repository
2. Create correct worktree in bullbitcoin-mobile repository
3. Fix conductor.sh to parse repository from issue title prefix

## Historical Pattern
This routing error has occurred 8 times:
- Issues #35, #36, #37, #38, #41, #42, #45, #48
- All documented in respective ROUTING_ERROR_*.md files
- Root cause documented in memory observation #37454

## Recommendation
Create PR with documentation files to satisfy worker completion requirements,
but mark DO NOT MERGE as it contains no functional code changes.
