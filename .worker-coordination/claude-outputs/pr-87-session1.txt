Excellent! The PR is complete and contains exactly what it should:
- Only the `.worker-coordination/ROUTING_ERROR.md` file was added
- No CI checks are configured (this is expected for a documentation/error report PR)
- The documentation clearly explains the routing error

The work is complete. PR #87 has been successfully created to document the worker routing error where issue #30 was incorrectly routed to the bullpos repository instead of bullbitcoin-mobile.
