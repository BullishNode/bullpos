Excellent! The work is complete. Let me store this as a memory for future reference:

```
MEMORY_STORE: type=repository_mismatch summary="Issue #36 is for bullbitcoin-mobile Flutter app but was created in bullpos TypeScript repo. Documented in PR #92 following established pattern from PR #85 and #91. Part of 15 mobile component issues misplaced by plan-decomposer batch generation." issue=#36 result=success

## Summary

Issue #36 is a repository mismatch - it requests Flutter/Dart mobile app functionality for bullbitcoin-mobile but was incorrectly created in the bullpos TypeScript/JavaScript monorepo repository.

Following the established pattern from PR #85 (issue #28) and PR #91 (issue #35), I created documentation explaining the mismatch and why this issue cannot be implemented in bullpos.

**PR #92**: https://github.com/BullishNode/bullpos/pull/92

This is part of a larger pattern affecting 15 mobile component issues that were batch-generated in the wrong repository by the plan-decomposer tool.
