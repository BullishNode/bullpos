The uncommitted change is just the root-level `package-lock.json` which is not needed for the PR. The implementation is complete and the PR has been successfully created.

## Summary

I successfully implemented AES-256-GCM decryption for payment link payloads in the BullPOS frontend:

### Files Created:
1. **`frontend/src/crypto/aes.ts`** - AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption module with:
   - `importAesKey()` - Imports 256-bit keys into WebCrypto
   - `decryptAesGcm()` - Decrypts payloads with nonce handling
   - `decryptJsonPayload()` - Decrypts and parses JSON payloads
   - `encryptAesGcm()` - Encrypts plaintext
   - `DecryptionError` class for error handling

2. **`frontend/src/utils/encoding.ts`** - Base64url encoding/decoding utilities:
   - `base64UrlEncode()` / `base64UrlDecode()` for strings
   - `base64UrlDecodeToBuffer()` / `base64UrlEncodeBuffer()` for ArrayBuffers

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
- ✅ Key imported successfully from base64url
- ✅ Decryption works with correct key
- ✅ Invalid key returns clear error
- ✅ Corrupted ciphertext returns clear error
- ✅ Decrypted payload parsed as JSON
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Lint passes
