## Work Complete

After thorough analysis of the btcpos codebase, I discovered that **all acceptance criteria for issue #17 are already fully implemented**. No new code was required.

### Key Findings

All requirements were met in the existing `frontend/index.ts`:

1. ✅ **Reverse swap creation** (line 730): `getBoltzSession().invoice(BigInt(satoshis), description, claimAddress)`
2. ✅ **Merchant's Liquid address** (lines 1114-1119): Derived from CT descriptor
3. ✅ **Claim keys stored** (lines 322-347): 12-word mnemonic in localStorage
4. ✅ **Lightning invoice with QR** (lines 969-1062): Full display with copy functionality
5. ✅ **Accurate amounts**: Proper fiat ↔ sats conversion

### Deliverables

- Created comprehensive `BOLTZ_INTEGRATION.md` documentation
- Verified build and lint pass successfully
- Created PR #75 documenting the existing implementation
