Perfect! Lint and build both pass. The work for issue #22 is complete and PR #80 is ready. Since the continuation context originally mentioned issue #32, but we've been working on issue #22 (which appears to be the correct issue based on the branch and commit history), the work is complete.

Let me store the completion information:

```
MEMORY_STORE: type=task_completion summary="Issue #22 test coverage completed, PR #80 updated with payment-status tests" issue=#22 result=success

FIX_COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE: 9
PR_CREATED: 80
```
