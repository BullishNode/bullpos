# Issue #42 - Session 3 Output
# Timestamp: 2026-01-28 02:51 AM CST

## Session Summary

**Status**: BLOCKED - Repository Routing Error
**Action Taken**: Created routing error documentation PR
**Outcome**: Documented systemic routing bug affecting issue #42

## Issue Analysis

Issue: #42 - [bullbitcoin-mobile] Add PDF attachment support to invoice builder
- Required Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile (Flutter/Dart mobile app)
- Current Repository: bullpos (TypeScript/Node.js web app)
- Compatibility: 0% (completely different platforms)

## Problem Details

The issue requests:
1. Add "Attach PDF" button to Flutter mobile UI
2. Use native mobile file picker for PDF selection
3. Update Dart models: InvoicePayload
4. Modify Flutter widgets: pdf_attachment.dart, invoice_builder_screen.dart

Available codebase provides:
1. TypeScript/Node.js web application (bullpos)
2. Browser-based POS system with React-like components
3. No Flutter code, no Dart files, no mobile UI infrastructure

Result: Cannot implement Flutter mobile features in TypeScript web codebase

## Root Cause

Vibelord conductor routing logic uses worktree filesystem paths to determine repository:
- Reads: /tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullpos/overnight/issue-42
- Extracts: "bullpos" (from path)
- Should read: "[bullbitcoin-mobile]" (from issue title prefix)

## Historical Context

Recurring pattern documented in:
- Memory #37451: Repository Routing Bug Identified
- Memory #37453: Session Blocked by Repository Mismatch
- Memory #37454: Conductor Routing Logic Fix Proposal

Previous affected issues:
- Issue #35 → PR #91 (routing error doc)
- Issue #36 → PR #92 (routing error doc)
- Issue #37 → PR #93 (routing error doc)
- Issue #38 → PR #94 (routing error doc)
- Issue #41 → PR #97 (routing error doc)

## Actions Taken

1. Verified repository identity: bullpos (confirmed via package.json)
2. Analyzed issue requirements: Flutter/Dart mobile code (incompatible)
3. Searched for precedent: Found PRs #91-#97 documenting routing errors
4. Created routing error documentation: .github/issues/ROUTING_ERROR_42.md
5. Captured session output: .worker-coordination/claude-outputs/42-session3.txt
6. Creating PR to satisfy completion signal requirement

## Recommendations

**Immediate**:
1. Close this PR (documentation only, no functional changes)
2. Create correct worktree in bullbitcoin-mobile repository
3. Re-assign issue #42 to correct repository context

**Long-term**:
1. Fix conductor.sh routing logic to parse [repo-name] from issue titles
2. Audit all active issues for potential misrouting
3. Add validation to detect tech stack mismatches early

## Completion Signal

Creating PR with routing error documentation to satisfy vibelord completion requirements.
