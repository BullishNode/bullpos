# Issue #50 - Session 1 Continuation
# Routing Error Detection and Documentation

## Detection Summary
- **Time**: 2026-01-28 03:09 AM CST
- **Issue**: #50 "Verify Phase 5 Payment History and Recovery complete"
- **Repository Context**: bullbitcoin-mobile (required) vs bullpos (actual)
- **Conclusion**: ROUTING ERROR - Cannot proceed

## Issue Analysis
Issue #50 explicitly states "Repositories: bullbitcoin-mobile" in the context section.
The issue requires:
- Testing payment history functionality in mobile app
- Verifying detail view displays correctly
- Testing recovery with intentionally failed swaps
- Running mobile integration tests

All of these are Flutter/Dart mobile application features that do not exist in the bullpos TypeScript/Node.js web repository.

## Tech Stack Incompatibility
- Required: Flutter/Dart mobile app (bullbitcoin-mobile)
- Available: TypeScript/Node.js web app (bullpos)
- Compatibility: 0%

## Batch Context
Issue #50 is part of batch-20260127-181138-2751594 (sequence 50 of 56).
This entire batch has systematic routing errors affecting mobile-tagged issues:
- Issues #42, #44, #45, #46, #47, #48 all documented as routing errors
- All require bullbitcoin-mobile but landed in bullpos
- PRs #98, #101-105 document this pattern

## Action Taken
Following established pattern from issues #42-48:
1. Created ROUTING_ERROR_50.md documentation file
2. Created this session log for diagnostic tracking
3. Will create PR with DO NOT MERGE recommendation
4. PR satisfies vibelord FIX_COMPLETE signal requirement

## Root Cause (Systemic)
Conductor routing logic extracts repository from worktree filesystem path:
  /tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullpos/overnight/issue-50 → "bullpos"

Should instead parse from issue metadata:
  Issue body: "Repositories: bullbitcoin-mobile"

## Recommendation
Close issue #50 in bullpos repository.
Re-assign to bullbitcoin-mobile repository with correct worktree context.
Fix conductor.sh to parse repository from issue metadata, not filesystem paths.
