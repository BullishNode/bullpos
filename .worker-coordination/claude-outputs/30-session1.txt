**CRITICAL ERROR**: Issue #30 is for the **bullbitcoin-mobile** repository (Dart/Flutter code) but this worker was routed to the **bullpos** repository (TypeScript). The issue requires implementing Liquid wallet derivation in Dart files that don't exist in bullpos.

**Created PR #87** to document this routing error. The worker coordinator needs to be fixed to:
1. Parse the `**Repository: [name]**` field from issue bodies
2. Create worktrees in the correct repository directory
3. Prevent cross-repository assignment errors

The correct worktree path should be `/tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullbitcoin-mobile/overnight/issue-30`, not `/tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullpos/overnight/issue-30`.
