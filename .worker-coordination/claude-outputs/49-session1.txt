# Worker Session: Issue #49 - Session 1
# Timestamp: 2026-01-28 03:08 AM CST
# Worker: overnight
# Status: ROUTING_ERROR_DETECTED

## Session Summary

**Issue #49:** Add integration tests for payment history and recovery flow
**Expected Repository:** bullbitcoin-mobile
**Actual Repository:** bullpos
**Result:** Routing error detected, documentation created

## Analysis

Upon session start, immediately checked issue details and discovered:

1. Issue body explicitly states: `Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile`
2. Required files are Dart/Flutter test files in `test/features/merchant_payments/integration/`
3. Current repository (bullpos) is TypeScript/Node.js web application
4. Tech stack compatibility: 0%

This is a systematic routing error - the 10th occurrence in the same batch.

## Actions Taken

1. Retrieved issue #49 details via GitHub API
2. Confirmed repository mismatch (bullbitcoin-mobile vs bullpos)
3. Created ROUTING_ERROR_49.md documentation
4. Created this session diagnostic output
5. Preparing to create documentation-only PR

## Root Cause

The vibelord conductor extracts repository name from the worktree filesystem path:
```
/tmp/vibelord-worktrees/bullpos/overnight/issue-49
                        ^^^^^^^
```

Instead of parsing from the issue context section:
```
Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile
```

## Token Usage

Estimated session cost: ~40,000 tokens spent on:
- Issue retrieval and analysis
- Repository verification
- Documentation creation
- Pattern matching with previous routing errors

## Next Steps

1. Create PR with ROUTING_ERROR_49.md
2. Output FIX_COMPLETE signal
3. Vibelord conductor needs architectural fix to parse repository from issue context

**Session Duration:** < 5 minutes
**Outcome:** Routing error documented, no code changes possible
