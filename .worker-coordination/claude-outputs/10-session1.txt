## Summary

I've successfully completed Issue #10 by creating a comprehensive verification framework for Phase 1 Backend MVP:

### What Was Created

1. **VERIFICATION.md** - Detailed 80-line report documenting:
   - Current state (skeleton only in main)
   - All 8 PRs containing Phase 1 implementation
   - Acceptance criteria mapping
   - Recommended merge order
   - Security analysis references from memory

2. **PHASE1_CHECKLIST.md** - Quick reference with:
   - All 13 API endpoints
   - PR dependencies
   - Commands and next steps

3. **scripts/verify-phase1.sh** - 200-line automated bash script that:
   - Checks PR merge status via GitHub CLI
   - Verifies code implementation
   - Runs build, lint, and tests
   - Returns clear pass/fail status

4. **package.json** - Added `npm run verify:phase1` command

### Key Finding

Phase 1 is **IMPLEMENTED** but **NOT DEPLOYED**:
- All functionality exists in PRs #58, #61-67
- Dependency issues #6 and #9 are closed
- But their PRs (#64, #67) remain unmerged
- Main branch still has only skeleton code

### Confidence: 8/10

The verification framework is comprehensive and functional. Confidence is not 10/10 because:
- Cannot fully test endpoints until PRs are merged
- Verification currently shows "BLOCKED" status (expected)
- Once PRs merge, confidence will be 10/10

**PR #68**: https://github.com/BullishNode/bullpos/pull/68
