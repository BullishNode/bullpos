# Issue #37 Repository Mismatch

## Summary
Issue #37 was created in the BullPOS repository but requires work in the **bullbitcoin-mobile** repository (Flutter/Dart mobile app).

## Evidence

### Issue Metadata
- **Title**: [bullbitcoin-mobile] Add unit tests for use cases and entities
- **Label**: component:mobile
- **Repository Context**: Explicitly states "Repository: bullbitcoin-mobile"

### Technical Requirements
The issue requires:
1. **Dart test files** with `.dart` extensions:
   - `test/features/merchant_payments/domain/merchant_payment_test.dart`
   - `test/features/merchant_payments/domain/invoice_payload_test.dart`
   - `test/features/merchant_payments/application/create_invoice_usecase_test.dart`
   - `test/features/merchant_payments/application/merchant_onboarding_usecase_test.dart`

2. **Flutter/Dart-specific testing**:
   - Testing domain entities and value objects
   - Testing use cases with mocked repositories
   - Testing error mapping between layers
   - Following ARCHITECTURE.md guidelines specific to the mobile app

3. **Dependencies on mobile issues**:
   - Depends on #28, #31, #33 (all mobile component issues)

### Current Repository
The BullPOS repository is a **TypeScript/JavaScript monorepo** containing:
- Frontend: TypeScript/Webpack application
- Backend: Express.js API server
- No Flutter/Dart code exists in this repository

## Root Cause
This issue was generated by plan-decomposer batch `batch-20260127-181138-2751594` (sequence 37 of 56). The same batch incorrectly routed 15 mobile component issues to the bullpos repository when they should target bullbitcoin-mobile.

## Related Issues
Other mobile component issues with similar repository mismatch:
- #28, #31, #33, #35, #36 (and others from the same batch)

## Resolution Options
1. **Transfer the issue** to the bullbitcoin-mobile repository
2. **Close this issue** and recreate it in the correct repository
3. **Document and close** this issue with reference to the correct location

## Recommendation
Close this issue with documentation (this PR) and recreate it in the bullbitcoin-mobile repository where it can be properly implemented.
